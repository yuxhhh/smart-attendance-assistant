# 📚 Smart Attendance Assistant  

A lightweight and user-friendly web app to help students track their **class attendance** and plan ahead.  
This project was built to solve a real problem: keeping track of subject-wise attendance, required hours, and how many classes you can afford to miss — all in one clean and easy dashboard.
